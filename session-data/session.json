When handling external requests, each service must consider mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, caching, rate limiting, and more. Additionally, each service may use a different programming language and implementation approach, which can lead to increased development and management costs.\r\n\r\nBy adopting the API Gateway pattern, we can address these challenges. The API Gateway takes on the responsibility of handling request details, allowing services to focus on their business logic. Furthermore, managers can easily manage and monitor the running of APIs in the system through the API Gateway.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will use Kong API Gateway as an example to demonstrate how to manage APIs and incorporate mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, caching, and rate limiting. We will also explore different architectural approaches with Kong and discuss their suitable use cases."},"speakers":["VHBJV3"],"tags":["zh-tw","Beginner"],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/ry8cx1ki2","qa":null,"slide":null,"record":null,"uri":"https://coscup.org/2023/session/SAXWES"},{"id":"SVTYTE","type":"6hx6fl","room":"TR 213","start":"2023-07-30T15:30:00+08:00","end":"2023-07-30T16:00:00+08:00","language":"中文","zh":{"title":"Go to Generics = Go to hell?

Apart from learning to code in p5.js, the book addresses the cultural and aesthetic dimensions of programming from its insides, as a means to think and act critically, and to understand the importance of programming as a cultural practice that can develop discussion of issues that are relatively under-acknowledged in technical subjects such as gender, race and sexuality. Importantly, the book is understood as a computational object, not released as a fixed and universal teaching resource, but rather a situated curriculum with the potential for extension and customization with other arts and coding communities. The use of Git has allowed the authors to formalize its production as an iterative process, allowing for reversioning and for others to fork a copy and customize with different references, examples, critical reflections and even new chapters.

With various operators provided by Airflow, we can flexibly and freely write various tasks based on Python or other languages, and define the upstream and downstream relationships of tasks using DAGs, to transform data into useful knowledge for AI-related services. However, in a data science team that focuses on structured data processing, a framework that is too flexible and free can actually increase the costs of operations, communication, and code inheritance. To solve this problem, Jeffrey developed an ETL framework based on Airflow in the Intelligent Finance Department of Esun Bank, which provides data scientists working with massive structured data with a more simplified and standardized ETL framework. They can focus on the three main elements: 1) the column definition of the data table, 2) the validation logic and 3) the transformation logic function writing and arrangement. The ETL framework can automatically integrate these three elements with Airflow at the underlying level, and allow for inspection of data tables, transformation logic, and validation logic in the Airflow UI."},"speakers":["HWKLFY"],"tags":["zh-tw","Beginner"],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/BJDeVkki3","qa":null,"slide":null,"record":null,"uri":"https://coscup.org/2023/session/FHMWYE"},{"id":"KFFWVA","type":"47pbg2","room":"RB 105","start":"2023-07-30T16:35:00+08:00","end":"2023-07-30T17:05:00+08:00","language":"English","zh":{"title":"⚡Lightning talk / 閃電秀⚡","description":"-"},"en":{"title":"⚡Lightning talk / 閃電秀⚡","description":"-"},"speakers":["9NRTBF"],"tags":["en","Beginner"],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/r1Di-y1i2","qa":null,"slide":null,"record":null,"uri":"https://coscup.org/2023/session/KFFWVA"},{"id":"LN8PAN","type":"58cfd2","room":"TR 413-1","start":"2023-07-30T10:50:00+08:00","end":"2023-07-30T11:20:00+08:00","language":"中文","zh":{"title":"搞懂 React 和 Rails 作為前後端分離夥伴的麻煩事","description":"前後端分離必定有溝通的代價，這次想聊聊 React 和 Rails 作為夥伴時，要做好的合作協議。\r\n環境變數、專案設定值、API 認證與規劃、App / Web Server 設定與溝通、正式環境部署、開發環境建置、雙方都能做到的事能否取代對方，這些事項會遇到什麼麻煩？進一步影響到雙方合作的方式和範圍，甚至會懷疑合作是否是好的選擇？我將提供我的看法。"},"en":{"title":"搞懂 React 和 Rails 作為前後端分離夥伴的麻煩事","description":"前後端分離必定有溝通的代價，這次想聊聊 React 和 Rails 作為夥伴時，要做好的合作協議。\r\n環境變數、專案設定值、API 認證與規劃、App / Web Server 設定與溝通、正式環境部署、開發環境建置、雙方都能做到的事能否取代對方，這些事項會遇到什麼麻煩？進一步影響到雙方合作的方式和範圍，甚至會懷疑合作是否是好的選擇？我將提供我的看法。"},"speakers":["MXZDWX"],"tags":["zh-tw","Beginner"],"co_write":"https://hackmd.io/@coscup/BJTd7y1sn","qa":null,"slide":null,"record":null,"uri":"https://coscup.org/2023/session/LN8PAN"},{"id":"AUMHPW","type":"7ljl63","room":"TR 313","start":"2023-07-30T11:20:00+08:00","end":"2023-07-30T11:50:00+08:00","language":"中文","zh":{"title":"在大學嘗試開源社團第一年的辛酸史","description":"在改革服務性社團並加入開源性質的社團，第一年所面臨的辛酸和挑戰。在社團改革之初，面臨了許多問題，例如如何吸引新成員、如何管理社團，以及推動開源相關的資源等等。他還需要學習如何使用各種開源工具和軟件來協助社團的運作。儘管面臨著這些困難，仍然堅持不懈地努力著，並最終建立了一個具有活力和積極性的服務暨開源結合的社團。"},"en":{"title":"The story of how difficult it is to start an open source community","description":"The hardships and challenges faced in reforming a service-oriented organization and joining an open-source community during the first year were considerable.

Through learning from others' shared experiences, he has been able to grow personally. At the same time, through his own sharing, he not only benefits others but also organizes his own thoughts. This positive cycle is a key flywheel in the speaker's career development.\r\n\r\nRegarding cross-domain practical experience, the speaker will share his learning experiences in different fields within the open-source community, ranging from being a COSCUP-GNOME Asia ambassador, a COSCUP sales team member, to being the project lead for Mozilla Support Localization. These experiences have given him the opportunity to challenge roles in product and technology integration departments. Through these practices, he has learned skills such as communication, sales, process breakdown, and organization, which he applies in his workplace and product planning, contributing to his professional development.\r\n\r\nLastly, the speaker emphasizes the importance of continuous interaction with people.

Mastodon, the new social networking site many chose after Elon Musk took over Twitter, is an excellent decentralized open-source solution. The decentralization of Mastodon is made possible by the ActivityPub protocol. Even more, relying on this protocol, Mastodon can create social links with other personal blogs, music-sharing tools, forums, and video-sharing websites that have implemented this protocol, demonstrating the potential to form a federated universe or \"Fediverse\".\r\n\r\nThis lecture will guide you through the world of ActivityPub.

This lecture will use the example of the Taiwan Cultural Memory Bank, which is established and maintained with significant government funding, to illustrate the problematic provisions it incorporates, deviations in understanding CC-NC (NonCommercial) and CC-ND (NoDerivs) licenses, and the lack of uniformity and respect in the release of information under CC-BY.

COODFA has been holding the agricultural track at COSCUP conference with OCF Taiwan since 2020, and we try to build a better environment for digital transformation in the agricultural industry."}},{"id":"JQGHUR","avatar":"https://pretalx.coscup.org/media/avatars/78717_Hws4RpO.jpg","zh":{"name":"陳增澤","bio":"我叫陳增澤，以前曾有多個暱稱，但最近比較習慣大家叫我藍光，這次在COSCUP的介紹的醫學影像軟體BlueLight，便是以我的暱稱(藍光)命名。我閒暇之餘喜歡投入寫作、繪圖、製作遊戲、編輯維基百科與部落格、研究電腦科學與大自然、開發新的軟體和演算法。由於我的專長是程式設計，也是樂於創作的人，喜歡將自己的軟體技術應用在插畫與遊戲等創作上面，也因此，影像便成為了我最常深入研究的領域。\r\n\r\n醫學影像是影像領域中令我感到值得深入研究的領域之一，這項技術不僅能幫助醫生進行治療、提升醫療水準，也能讓學生和醫護人員可以透過影像學習到更多知識。希望之後可以開發更多這方面的開放原始碼專案，並改善BlueLight，幫助研究人員在醫療領域補上更多拼圖 ( •̀ ω •́ )✧"},"en":{"name":"陳增澤","bio":"我叫陳增澤，以前曾有多個暱稱，但最近比較習慣大家叫我藍光，這次在COSCUP的介紹的醫學影像軟體BlueLight，便是以我的暱稱(藍光)命名。我閒暇之餘喜歡投入寫作、繪圖、製作遊戲、編輯維基百科與部落格、研究電腦科學與大自然、開發新的軟體和演算法。由於我的專長是程式設計，也是樂於創作的人，喜歡將自己的軟體技術應用在插畫與遊戲等創作上面，也因此，影像便成為了我最常深入研究的領域。\r\n\r\n醫學影像是影像領域中令我感到值得深入研究的領域之一，這項技術不僅能幫助醫生進行治療、提升醫療水準，也能讓學生和醫護人員可以透過影像學習到更多知識。希望之後可以開發更多這方面的開放原始碼專案，並改善BlueLight，幫助研究人員在醫療領域補上更多拼圖 ( •̀ ω •́ )✧"}},{"id":"NEHU7J","avatar":"https://pretalx.coscup.org/media/avatars/profile_z8YEbpG.jpg","zh":{"name":"Blaise Tine","bio":"Blaise Tine is  a Professor in Computer Science Department at University of California, Los Angeles.
